                <p>
                    Hello! I'm Li Songtao, a passionate Communications Engineering student with a strong interest in Blockchain, Federated Learning, and Machine Learning. 
                    I have been working on various projects involving these cutting-edge technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey began in 2022 when I started my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University. Since then, I have developed a deep expertise in areas like Integrated Circuit System Design and Mathematical Modeling.
                    I am always excited about new challenges and love to learn and grow through my work.
                </p>
